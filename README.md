## Overview

**EnviroIntelKE** is an advanced environmental threat intelligence platform by [Cyb3rch37](https://github.com/Cyb3rch37) tailored for developers seeking reliable, scalable monitoring solutions. It combines comprehensive backend API testing, structured quality assurance protocols, and a modular frontend architecture to streamline development and deployment.

## Features

- **Full Stack:** Combines Python (FastAPI, Typer, Pydantic, NumPy, pandas) and JavaScript (React, Axios, npm/Yarn, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, ESLint).
- **Modern Frontend:** Built with React for interactive UI.
- **Robust Backend:** FastAPI powers the backend API, with data models using Pydantic.
- **Testing:** Automated tests via Pytest.
- **Data Handling:** Uses pandas and NumPy for data analysis.
- **Linting & Formatting:** Ensured by ESLint and PostCSS plugins.
- **Dependency Management:** Supports npm and Yarn.
